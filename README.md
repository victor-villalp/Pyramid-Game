## Gameplay
The player must search for treasure and escape alive with the Sword of Ra, but creatures will stand on the way. Beetles 
move horizontally at a constant speed, but when the player is within close proximity they double in speed.Scorpions 
behave similarly as beetles but move horizontally. Mummies follow the player if the player is within a predetermined 
radius. To help player on its journey power ups are strategically placed across the map. Potion power ups add an extra 
life to the player and the pistol power ups grant the player a pistol with three bullets which can be used to kill any 
creature. Note: Activate the light of the Sword of Ra to find your way out of the pyramid but doing so decreases your
final score. Use scarab to scare nearby mummies for 10 seconds.
